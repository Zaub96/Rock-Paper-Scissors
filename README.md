# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Created a simple version of the game Rock Paper Scissors
I learned how to allow user input with the input() command which was a step needed for the improvement of the discord bot.
Structure is a simple flow of if elif statements that covers all possible outcomes.
Next step is implementation into the discord image bot!
Ran on Python Version: 3.6.5
